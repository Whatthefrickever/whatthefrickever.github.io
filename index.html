        </h2>

        <p>
            Hello, I am Todd! If you've found this website somehow, you probably already know who I am, so I'll be direct.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience with web deisgn, and presumably you're in the market for someone with that experience. I have a strong preference for minimalistic asethetics. I perfer function over form, and my ethos can be described as 'Professional, but not Impersonal.'
        </p>
        <p>
            For your Convience I have constructed a sampling of website elements I have experience utilizing on the aptly titled, <a href="experience.html" class="quietLink">Examples</a> page that you can review at your own discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in working with me, the <a href="contact.html" class="quietLink">Contact</a> page has all that relevent information.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Thank you for your time and attention!
        </h3>
        <p>
            Enjoy this picture of a cat, that will disappear if you try to zoom in on him, don't worry about it too much, he's just very shy.
